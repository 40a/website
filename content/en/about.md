My name is Vincent Batoufflet and I’m a _Systems and Networks Engineer_ interested in new technologies, free
software and tons of Go, Python and web development related stuff.

When not dealing with computers, I enjoy music (learning drums), cinema, watching a lot of TV shows and reading books.

<span class="fa fa-map-marker"></span> I’m currently living in Paris, France.

If you want to contact me, don’t hesitate to take a look at the [contact page](en/contact/).
